# spam-scout
The one mistake companies make that leaves them vulnerable to phishing attacks is....
Not having the right tools in place and failing to train employees on their role in information security.So, here it is a web-extension used for detecting and reporting phishing websites, based on person's community connections. Here, we have used Facebook Graph API for creating a person's community. From this community a person can choose people to create which is know as the 'Trust Circle'. Based on these connections and their reports the user will be informed about the various phising threats.
It is an effort for the betterment of society, an effort for providing a secure platform.

## Build Process
- Download project directory from ""
- Include it in chrome browser
- Login to the extension
- Create your own Trust Circle to get your spam scout started in order to protect you from various cyber threats.

## Why spam-scout?
There are number of users who purchase products online and make payment through various websites.There are multiple websites who ask user to provide sensitive data such as username, password or credit card details etc. often for malicious reasons. This type of websites is known as phishing website.
The purpose of phishing is to collect sensitive information with the intention of using that information to gain access to otherwise protected data, networks, etc. A phisher's success is contingent upon establishing trust with its victims. We live in a digital age, and gathering information has become much easier as we are well beyond the dumpster diving days.
It is better to be informed about such threats, this is what the main aim of this app is.

## Technologies Explored
Here are few of the major resources we explored while building this app.

- Graph API Overview

The Graph API is the primary way to get data out of, and put data into, Facebook's platform. It's a low-level HTTP-based API that you can use to programmatically query data, post new stories, manage ads, upload photos, and perform a variety of other tasks that an app might implement.

- Neo4j

Neo4jâ€™s Graph Platform is specifically optimized to map, analyze, store and traverse networks of connected data to reveal invisible contexts and hidden relationships. By intuitively mapping data points and the connections between them.

- WHOIS

WHOIS (pronounced as the phrase who is) is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block, or an autonomous system, but is also used for a wider range of other information.

- Random Forest Classifier

Random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. It then aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object.

## Future Features
Some of the features that could be included in future to make this app better includes 

- Providing the user to access connections from other social platforms like Gmail.com, Outlook.com and many more.
- Extend its accessibilty on other platforms like Android and iOS
- Adding support on Firefox and others as well(at present it is supported on Chrome).
